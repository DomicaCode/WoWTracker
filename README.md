# WoWTracker
WoW Mount Tracker Project

Project with a functional login/signup system where you can input your WoW Character/Realm and it spits out the mounts you currently do not have.

To use - You have to import mounts.sql as it contains all the mounts available, users.sql is preferable as well if you do not wish to change the code. If you do import users.sql, you can use admin admin to login.

Database used - MySQL, if you cannot import the .sql files, there is a chunk of code in charinfo.inc.php that fills up your database with all of the mounts.
